# ZedScript

Help, I'm addicted to making programming languages and I can't stop!

## Current Task

I've built my own parser builder, but right now the code it generates is terribly slow. Rather than make it generate fast code, I want to generate code in an IR, write some general optimization for the IR, and use that to increase my performace.

Current lines of code: 861/630
